        <h1>Restaurants</h1>
        <p>As you can probably imagine, an enormous amount of food is wasted or thrown out at restaurants all across the
          country every single day. That piece of chicken you left on your plate because you were too full, or those
          that giant stack of pancakes that the table next to you didn’t finish — it’s all going to be thrown out. Or
          how about the meal that was asked to be taken back because it didn’t please the customer? Again, this food is
          usually wasted and will wind up in a landfill.According to a recent report, a half a pound of food is wasted
          per meal in restaurants, whether it’s from what
          is left on a customer’s plate, or in the kitchen itself. Approximately 85% of the food that isn’t used in a
          typical American restaurant is thrown out while only a small percentage is recycled or donated. With more than
          42 million food insecure people in our country, this amount of food waste is obviously a major problem.
          The first step toward reducing the amount of food we waste is to change the behavior of the public, as well as
          chefs and workers at these restaurants, by finding better and smarter ways to use this food in the kitchen,
          diverting the food to food banks, or composting the food that would have otherwise been wasted.</p>

        <h1>Supermarkets </h1>
        <p>Food retailers are gatekeepers to the U.S. food system. They influence what products travel from farms to
          shelves,and help determine consumer shopping trends. For these reasons especially, grocers are increasingly under
          pressure to reduce their food waste footprint.
          For instance, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) recently took the industry by surprise, grading the
          country's top 10 largest supermarkets on their waste reduction efforts. Only three got an A. The rest got bad
          publicity.</p>

          <p>"Every year, American consumers, businesses, and farms spends $218 billion a year,
            or 1.3% of GDP, growing, processing, transporting, and disposing food that is never eaten."

          <h2>Food Waste Prevention</h2>
          <ul>
              <li><b>DONATING :</b></li>
            When shopping for groceries, many consumers check the back of the shelf for the most recently added product
            with furthest sell-by date. Business Insider shared its insight on sell-by dates, noting that "consumers
            (and many sellers) wrongly assume that food is no longer good after these days," going on to explain that
            "sell-by dates are guidelines for sellers to indicate peak freshness," and that "most foods are good long after the sell-by date." The
            suggested date can be intimidating to consumers, often leading them to a different item. Once these items
            aren't purchased, grocers end up disposing of them in the trash.
            <li><b>PREVENTION :</b></li>
              Grocers can pride themselves on their beautiful produce pyramids, but occasionally those displays could
              actually harm the earth. At the bottom of these
              shiny stacks is produce with more blemishes.Considering that these items are placed on the bottom, those
              blemishes then worsen and lead to an overstock.Some grocers might assume that consumers are more likely to buy off a full shelf.
              However, putting an abundance of produce on display can result in perishable items going bad before
              they're sold and consumed.
              <li><b>DISCOUNTING</b></li>
            One of the easiest options to reduce food waste is to discount any damaged goods in stock. These items
            typically  get no shelf life because grocers choose to dispose of them, since they've been dented or damaged in
            transit.Stores assume that there's no point in putting the items out for sale because they don't have cosmetic
            appeal.Consumers expect grocery stores to look perfect, but at the end of the day, they're likely to buy discounted
            canned items even if they're dented. If these items are still put on the shelf at a discounted price due to
            their imperfections, the amount of immediate food waste from the grocer will automatically be significantly
            lower.
              <li><b>DONATING</b></li>
            When shopping for groceries, many consumers check the back of the shelf for the most recently added product
            with furthest sell-by date. Business Insider shared its insight on sell-by dates, noting that "consumers
            (and many sellers) wrongly assume that food is no longer good after these days," going on to explain that
            "sell-by dates are guidelines for sellers to indicate peak freshness," and that "most foods are good long after the sell-by date." The
            suggested date can be intimidating to consumers, often leading them to a different item. Once these items
            aren't purchased, grocers end up disposing of them in the trash.
              <li><b>COMPOST</b></li>
            A best practice for eliminating food waste from grocers is composting. Instead of tossing old or imperfect
            food in the trash, grocers can reduce their food waste by having a composting system. Once you pull organic
            material from recyclable material, having full access to a composting system will quickly lower how much
            waste is sent to a landfill from a grocery store.
