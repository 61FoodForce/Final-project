    <p class="food-waste-container-text">
        Over one third of all available food in the United States gets thrown away (USDA). Food waste that ends up in landfills produces a large amount of methane – a more powerful greenhouse gas than even CO2.
        For the uninitiated, excess amounts of greenhouse gases such as methane, CO2 and chloroflurocarbons absorb infrared radiation and heat up the earth’s atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change.With agriculture accounting for 70 percent of the water used throughout the world, food waste also represents a great waste of
        freshwater and ground water resources.

    <p class="hunger-container-text">
        Each year, millions of Americans are impacted by hunger and food insecurity. Experiencing food insecurity at a young age can lead to lasting health concerns 
        especially if families facing hunger are forced to choose between spending money on food or on medical care. When communities have access to healthy, well-balanced diets, everyone benefits.
        The USDA defines "food insecurity" as the lack of access, at times, to enough food for all household members. In 2017, an estimated 15 million households were food insecure.
        With 1 in 6 American children not knowing where their next meal is coming from they are at a higher risk of developing asthma, struggling with anxiety or depression, and performing poorly in school or physical activities.

<!-- While food loss happens mainly at the production stage due to insufficient skills, natural calamities, lack of proper infrastructure and poor practices, food waste occurs when edible food is intentionally discarded by consumers after they fail to plan their meals properly and store food till it spoils or goes past the expiry date.
At times, food waste can also happen due to oversupply in markets. Retailers also tend to reject a lot of food because it doesn’t conform to their quality and aesthetic standards. -->
