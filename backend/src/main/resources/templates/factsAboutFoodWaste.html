    <p class="food-waste-container-text">
        In the United States, more than one third of available food gets thrown away <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste">(USDA).</a>
        The food that we throw away ends up in landfills, where it decomposes and creates large amounts of a gas called methane.
        Like carbon dioxide, methane is considered a green house gas due to how easily it can absorbs the sun's heat, which contributes to climate change.
