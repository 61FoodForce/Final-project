          <p><br>Food gets thrown out at restaurants, its not a fact that is hard to come to terms with. But What if we told you that 
          before the food even reaches the consumer at restaurants, Approximately 10% of the food purchased by the restaurant has already gone to waste.</br>
           <br>Now that fact is harder too swallow.</br>
          <br>As time continues to progress, so has our meals. Restaurant portion sizes have grown immensely compared to what they used to be a couple of decades ago, 
        ranging from 2-8 times larger than what the FDA or USDA recommend for serving sizes. The increase in serving size leads to restaurants needing to buy more ingredients to cook each meal.
        Unfortunately, it is too often that people don't finish their meals or that restaurants don't use all their ingredients.
         Approximately 85% of the food that isnâ€™t used in a restaurant in the US is thrown out while only a small percentage is recycled or donated. With more than
        42 million people in our country not knowing were their next meal in coming from, this amount of food waste alarming.
        To move foreword in the continual pursuit to help feed people in need, we need to find smarter and more efficient ways too use food in restaurants.
        Helping to guide and connect the food that is not going to be used to people in need. </p>

          <h1>Supermarkets</h1>
          <p><br>Grocery stores will spend billions of dollars a year to get the food you and I will pull off the shelves and into our homes.
          Grocery stores have a big sway on what gets bought from the farms, and help shape consumer shopping trends.
          With grocery stores having a great impact on the food being bought, grocery stores have a responsibility to reduce their great amount of food waste.
          The Center for Biological Diversity recently come out with surprising research, grading the country's top 10 largest supermarkets on their waste reduction efforts.
          only three out of those ten supermarkets got an A. </br></p>

          <p>"Every year, American consumers, businesses, and farms spends $218 billion a year,
            or 1.3% of GDP, growing, processing, transporting, and disposing food that is never eaten."

          <h2>Food Waste Prevention</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>DONATING :</b></li>
            When out buying our groceries for the week, It would be normal to look at the expiration dates of the product you want, and get the one that has the farthest expiration.
            It makes sense! We want the biggest bang for our buck, but recently Business Insider shared its intuition on sell-by dates.
            Business Insider notes that "consumers(and many sellers) wrongly assume that food is no longer good after these days," going on to explain that
            "sell-by dates are guidelines for sellers to indicate peak freshness," and that "most foods are good long after the sell-by date."
            When we grab a bag of bread and see it has sooner expiration date compared to another bag, we fear that the bread will rot away in our hands as we hold it, dropping it and picking up the newer one.
            What we didn't think of is that once everyone drops that perfectly fine bag of bread, the grocery store will trash it, where it will inevitably rot away.
            <br></br>

              <li><b>PREVENTION :</b></li>
              Grocery stores like to say that a consumer has a higher likely hood of buying an item off of a shelf if they see it is full.
              So they dedicate hours, making every shelf is full with items. But with that much produce on display, it leads to perishable going bad before they are even
              sold.
              <br></br>

            <li><b>DISCOUNTING</b></li>
            A great way to help reduce food waste is to reduce the price of any damaged item. Damaged items often gets tossed by grocery stores, getting no chance 
            on the shelf due to the item getting dinged or dented getting to the store or if it gets dropped by a customer. 
            People expect to buy items without any blemishes when they are shopping, willing to push aside a can with a dent for one without.
            but if that item is discounted due to the damage, people have a higher likely hood of buying that item, eliminating the waste that could 
            of been if the store had just thrown it away.
            <br></br>

              <li><b>COMPOST</b></li>
            A best practice for eliminating food waste from grocers is composting. Instead of tossing old or imperfect
            food in the trash, grocers can reduce their food waste by having a composting system. Once you pull organic
            material from recyclable material, having full access to a composting system will quickly lower how much
            waste is sent to a landfill from a grocery store.
