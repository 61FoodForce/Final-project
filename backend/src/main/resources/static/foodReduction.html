        <h1><br>Restaurants<br></h1>
        <!-- <p><br>As you can probably imagine, an enormous amount of food is wasted or thrown out at restaurants all across the
          country every single day. That piece of chicken you left on your plate because you were too full, or
          that giant stack of pancakes that the table next to you didn’t finish — it’s all going to be thrown out. Or
          how about the meal that was asked to be taken back because it didn’t please the customer? Again, this food is
          usually wasted and will wind up in a landfill.According to a recent report, a half a pound of food is wasted
          per meal in restaurants, whether it’s from what
          is left on a customer’s plate, or in the kitchen itself. Approximately 85% of the food that isn’t used in a
          typical American restaurant is thrown out while only a small percentage is recycled or donated. With more than
          42 million food insecure people in our country, this amount of food waste is obviously a major problem.
          The first step toward reducing the amount of food we waste is to change the behavior of the public, as well as
          chefs and workers at these restaurants, by finding better and smarter ways to use this food in the kitchen,
          diverting the food to food banks, or composting the food that would have otherwise been wasted.</br></p> -->

          <p><br>Food gets thrown out at restaurants, its not a fact that is hard to come to terms with. But What if we told you that 
          before the food even reaches the consumer at restaurants, Approximately 10% of the food purchased by the restaurant has already gone to waste.</br>
           <br>Now that fact is harder too swallow.</br>
          <br>As time continues to progress, so has our meals. Restaurant portion sizes have grown immensely compared to what they used to be a couple of decades ago, 
        ranging from 2-8 times larger than what the FDA or USDA recommend for serving sizes. The increase in serving size leads to restaurants needing to buy more ingredients to cook each meal.
        Unfortunately, it is too often that people don't finish their meals or that restaurants don't use all their ingredients.
         Approximately 85% of the food that isn’t used in a restaurant in the US is thrown out while only a small percentage is recycled or donated. With more than
        42 million people in our country not knowing were their next meal in coming from, this amount of food waste alarming.
        To move foreword in the continual pursuit to help feed people in need, we need to find smarter and more efficient ways too use food in restaurants.
        Helping to guide and connect the food that is not going to be used to people in need. </p>


          <h1>Supermarkets</h1>
        <!-- <p><br>Food retailers are gatekeepers to the U.S. food system. They influence what products travel from farms to
          shelves,and help determine consumer shopping trends. For these reasons especially, grocers are increasingly under
          pressure to reduce their food waste footprint.
          For instance, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) recently took the industry by surprise, grading the
          country's top 10 largest supermarkets on their waste reduction efforts. Only three got an A. The rest got bad
          publicity.</br></p> -->
          <p><br>Grocery stores will spend billions of dollars a year to get the food you and I will pull off the shelves and into our homes.
          Grocery stores have a big sway on what gets bought from the farms, and help shape consumer shopping trends.
          With grocery stores having a great impact on the food being bought, grocery stores have a responsibility to reduce their great amount of food waste.
          The Center for Biological Diversity recently come out with surprising research, grading the country's top 10 largest supermarkets on their waste reduction efforts.
          only three out of those ten supermarkets got an A. </br></p>

          <p>"Every year, American consumers, businesses, and farms spends $218 billion a year,
            or 1.3% of GDP, growing, processing, transporting, and disposing food that is never eaten."

          <h2>Food Waste Prevention</h2>
          <ul>
              <li><b>DONATING :</b></li>
            <!-- When shopping for groceries, many consumers check the back of the shelf for the most recently added product
            with furthest sell-by date. Business Insider shared its insight on sell-by dates, noting that "consumers
            (and many sellers) wrongly assume that food is no longer good after these days," going on to explain that
            "sell-by dates are guidelines for sellers to indicate peak freshness," and that "most foods are good long after the sell-by date." The
            suggested date can be intimidating to consumers, often leading them to a different item. Once these items
            aren't purchased, grocers end up disposing of them in the trash. -->
            <!-- <br></br> -->
            <li><b>DONATING :</b></li>
            When out buying our groceries for the week, It would be normal to look at the expiration dates of the product you want, and get the one that has the farthest expiration.
            It makes sense! We want the biggest bang for our buck, but recently Business Insider shared its intuition on sell-by dates.
            Business Insider notes that "consumers(and many sellers) wrongly assume that food is no longer good after these days," going on to explain that
            "sell-by dates are guidelines for sellers to indicate peak freshness," and that "most foods are good long after the sell-by date."
            When we grab a bag of bread and see it has sooner expiration date compared to another bag, we fear that the bread will rot away in our hands as we hold it, dropping it and picking up the newer one.
            What we didn't think of is that once everyone drops that perfectly fine bag of bread, the grocery store will trash it, where it will inevitably rot away.
            <br></br>

            <!-- <li><b>PREVENTION :</b></li>
              Grocers can pride themselves on their beautiful produce pyramids, but occasionally those displays could
              actually harm the earth. At the bottom of these
              shiny stacks is produce with more blemishes.Considering that these items are placed on the bottom, those
              blemishes then worsen and lead to an overstock.Some grocers might assume that consumers are more likely to buy off a full shelf.
              However, putting an abundance of produce on display can result in perishable items going bad before
              they're sold and consumed.
              <br></br> -->

              <li><b>PREVENTION :</b></li>
              Grocery stores like to say that a consumer has a higher likely hood of buying an item off of a shelf if they see it is full.
              So they dedicate hours, making every shelf is full with items. But with that much produce on display, it leads to perishable going bad before they are even
              sold.
              <br></br>

              <li><b>DISCOUNTING</b></li>
            One of the easiest options to reduce food waste is to discount any damaged goods in stock. These items
            typically  get no shelf life because grocers choose to dispose of them, since they've been dented or damaged in
            transit.Stores assume that there's no point in putting the items out for sale because they don't have cosmetic
            appeal.Consumers expect grocery stores to look perfect, but at the end of the day, they're likely to buy discounted
            canned items even if they're dented. If these items are still put on the shelf at a discounted price due to
            their imperfections, the amount of immediate food waste from the grocer will automatically be significantly
            lower.
            <br></br>
            <li><b>DISCOUNTING</b></li>
            A great way to help reduce food waste is to reduce the price of any damaged item. Damaged items often gets tossed by grocery stores, getting no chance 
            to on the shelf due to the item getting dinged or dented getting to the store or d
            <br></br>

              <li><b>COMPOST</b></li>
            A best practice for eliminating food waste from grocers is composting. Instead of tossing old or imperfect
            food in the trash, grocers can reduce their food waste by having a composting system. Once you pull organic
            material from recyclable material, having full access to a composting system will quickly lower how much
            waste is sent to a landfill from a grocery store.
