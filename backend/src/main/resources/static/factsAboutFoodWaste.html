<!-- While food loss happens mainly at the production stage due to insufficient skills, natural calamities, lack of proper infrastructure and poor practices, food waste occurs when edible food is intentionally discarded by consumers after they fail to plan their meals properly and store food till it spoils or goes past the expiry date.
At times, food waste can also happen due to oversupply in markets. Retailers also tend to reject a lot of food because it doesnâ€™t conform to their quality and aesthetic standards. -->
