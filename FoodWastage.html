   <p>As you can probably imagine, an enormous amount of food is wasted or thrown out at restaurants all across the country every single day. That piece of chicken you left on your plate because you were too full, or those that giant stack of pancakes that the table next to you didn’t finish — it’s all going to be thrown out. Or how about the meal that was asked to be taken back because it didn’t please the customer? Again, this food is usually wasted and will wind up in a landfill.
    According to a recent report, a half a pound of food is wasted per meal in restaurants, whether it’s from what is left on a customer’s plate, or in the kitchen itself. Approximately 85% of the food that isn’t used in a typical American restaurant is thrown out while only a small percentage is recycled or donated. With more than 42 million food insecure people in our country, this amount of food waste is obviously a major problem.
    The first step toward reducing the amount of food we waste is to change the behavior of the public, as well as chefs and workers at these restaurants, by finding better and smarter ways to use this food in the kitchen, diverting the food to food banks, or composting the food that would have otherwise been wasted.</p>
